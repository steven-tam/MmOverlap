# Gopher Major Planner
A project from Social Coding Club at the University of Minnesota!

Gopher Major Planner serves as the solution for UofM students who plan on pursuing a combination of majors and minors that exhibit significant overlap. It helps students make informed decisions regarding their majors, minors, and courses by offering tailored insights based on intended major and past coursework.

## Instructions for Running Locally
We are still in development.
Assuming no experience using react and node.js start with these commands 
using gitbash or equivalent:

To run frontend:
1. cd MmOverlap
2. cd frontend
3. npm run dev
4. Go to http://localhost:5173/

To run backend:
1. cd MmOverlap
2. cd backend
3. npm run dev
or npm start
